Unlike in Object Oriented Programming where the students are stored as objects, here we store the students in an array. This is because as stated by Williams [\\[1\\]](#fp101), it is better practice to use hashes and arrays instead of other data structures like objects so as to simplify the process of dealing with data and how it behaves in a system [\\[1\\]](#fp101). With this program, the user is able to update one or all of the student's GPA scores using the two above functions. Instead of using a loop to update each students grade, the changeGPA method is called in the the changeGPA's method on each student and the result is a newly formed array that doesn't change the old array's data.
