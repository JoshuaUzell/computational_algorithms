# Computational Algorithms
By Joshua Uzell

# Purpose of repo
This repo's purpose is to showcase my work for the Computational Theory Module in my Computer Science Course at ATU. This repo contains a folder called "Jupyter Notebook" which holds a Jupyter notebook called "countdown.ipynb" where my work for the assessment takes place.

# countdown.ipynb
This notebook goes over the numbers game problem in relation to the game show Countdown. The goal of this notebook is to explain the problem that is trying to be solved and then offer various solutions to the problem. We'll start off with a rough solution that isn't very efficient and then we'll gradually implement other more efficient solutions as we progress through the assessment. 

# How to run the code
